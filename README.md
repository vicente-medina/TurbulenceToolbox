# TurbulenceToolbox
MATLAB scripts to analyze turbulence in ADV/LDV sensor data.

It is an ongoing project. The first beta version is still being completed. February is plannend for releasing the first version.

This project is being developed in UPC (BarcelonaTech) in the DEHMA Department.

The contributors to the project are:

	Anna Mujal
	Cristina Fernandez
	Khaled Ahmed
	Vicente Medina

This toolbox is implemented on  MATLAB platform. It is focused in analyzing ADV/LDV timeseries. It provides several scripts including data filtering, basic statitical analysis and advanced analysis including power spectrum computation. The instruments used to test the program are Sontek Vectrinos and Nortek ADV.
